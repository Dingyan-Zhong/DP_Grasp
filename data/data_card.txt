Dataset Schema:

session_id: str, the id of the brain session

point_map: np.array in shape [3, H, W], the point cloud inside the RoI

normal_map: np.array in shape [3, H, W], the unit normal vector at each point

depth_map: np.array in shape [H, W], the depth of each point in the RoI

obj_mask: np.array in shape [H, W], the mask of the selected object, decided by on which object the best grasp point is

image: np.array in shape [3, H, W], the RoI resized image

obj_point_map: np.array in shape [3, H_obj, W_obj], point map cropped using the 2d bbox of the object's mask. The dimensions may vary across objects and scenes.

obj_depth_map: np.array in shape [H_obj, W_obj], depth map cropped using the 2d bbox of the object's mask. The dimensions may vary across objects and scenes.

obj_rgb: np.array in shape [3, H_obj, W_obj], RGB image cropped using the 2d bbox of the object's mask. The dimensions may vary across objects and scenes.

obj_bbox: np.array in shape [4, ], [x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max], describing the 2d bbox of a slightly enlarged mask of the object on the original RGB image.

top_grasp_r7: np.array in shape [7, ], the best collision-free grasp point on the selected object, (x, y, z, axis-angle rotation, width)

all_grasps_on_top_obj_r7: np.array in shape [N_grasp, 7], all collision-free grasp points on the selected object, including the best one. N_grasp may vary across scenes.

top_grasp_r9: np.array in shape [9, ], the best collision-free grasp point on the selected object, (x,y,z for two finger tips, negated Z axis of the tcp frame in the camera frame, which is also the inversed direction of approaching)

all_grasps_on_top_obj_r9: np.array in shape [N_grasp, 9], all collision-free grasp points on the selected object, including the best one. N_grasp may vary across scenes.

reference_camera_intrinsics: np.array in shape [3, 3], the RoI resized reference camera intrinsics.

split: str, whether the datum is in the "train" or "val" split
